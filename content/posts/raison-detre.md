**Liberty is not a gift from the state. It is a discipline of the mind.**

Welcome to *Ideas for Liberty*.

We live in an era where "freedom" is often traded for convenience, and "safety" is purchased with silence. The digital age promised us a new frontier of expression, but it has increasingly delivered surveillance, algorithmic curation, and the centralization of thought.

I am **Delacroix Paine**.

I chose this name to bridge two eras of revolution. **Eugène Delacroix**, who painted *Liberty Leading the People*, understood that freedom is chaotic, visceral, and often terrifying. **Thomas Paine**, the author of *Common Sense*, understood that liberty requires clear, accessible, and unyielding logic.
