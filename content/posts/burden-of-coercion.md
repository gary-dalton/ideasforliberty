Liberty is the goal. But survival is the prerequisite.

There is a seductive simplicity in the idea that "all coercion is wrong." It creates a neat moral universe. But it ignores the messy reality of the human condition. We are not just isolated individuals; we are a species that relies on community for survival.

**The state is a dangerous tool, but a necessary one.**

### The Justification of Force

If we accept that the role of society is to flourish, then we must accept that some freedoms must be surrendered to purchase that flourishing. We trade the "freedom" to drive on the wrong side of the road for the safety of transport. We trade the "freedom" to hoard every penny for the existence of a hospital.

However, this coercion must be strictly limited to areas where the **Public Good** undeniably outweighs the **Individual Cost**:

1.  **Capacity:** You cannot be free if you are enslaved by addiction or psychosis. Intervention in severe mental health crises is not the theft of liberty; it is the attempt to restore the capacity for it.
2.  **The Commons:** Markets fail. They do not build roads for free, and they do not protect the air we breathe. Taxation is the subscription fee for the infrastructure that makes commerce possible.
3.  **The Foundation:** A child has a right to an education that supersedes a parent's right to ignorance. Public schooling is the baseline defense against the destruction of liberty.

> **"Liberty without obligation is merely license for chaos."**

### The Danger of the Slope

Acknowledging that coercion is *sometimes* legitimate does not mean we should embrace it warmly. We must always view it with suspicion, question the motives of those wishing to deploy it, and remove it when its usefulness is superceded.

**The Necessary Caution**
We do not embrace the state; we accept it. We acknowledge it is necessary, but we insist it remains **compliant to the people**.

### Vigilance Against Convenience

Because we accept some coercion (vaccines to stop plagues, taxes to build bridges), we must be **vigilant** against its expansion, or of any movement toward coercion for its own sake, or worse, for the sake of **administrative convenience**.

The danger is in the failure of the state, not its existence. We must weigh the health of our communities against the liberty of the individual. We do this while understanding that when it is used simply to make the things easier to manage, it is tyranny. The state serves the people, and we must not forget that.

We accept the burden of coercion. But we must never stop weighing it.
